*Execution:

During implementation phase, I was responsible for investigating, collecting, recording the clients¡¯ requirements, and master data. What¡¯s more, I need to manage the data and make it go well in the system to build the SAP/HANA system. I produced good quality work with limited amount of time and oriented instructions from seniors. With a large amount of data and many new requirements to deal with, I managed and balanced these by setting a priority for each item and strictly following it. I could always finish these work in advance and offered to share other colleagues¡¯ work in our team. With concentration and focus on work, I could finish my work with high efficiency.
I have also handled multiple tasks simultaneously. I sometimes got a call from a system user. At the meantime, another user turned to me for help. Under this circumstance, I will ask another consultant to explain to the customer politely that I was busy with this call now and would call him back. Thus I can solve both problems to customers¡¯ satisfaction.
To be able to better support the implement of the future SAP solution, I often share extra time to learn SAP system after work. And I am able to implement the SAP system after half and a month¡¯s learning.
I could always find where to improve and provide efficient suggestions to perfect work. I helped build the new SAP system of Enshi water conservancy and hydropower in time.

*Relationships:

Client focus/partnership:
During this phase, I had many opportunities to manage client relationships, as I had to deal directly with clients. I have built credibility and gained trust from the client by delivering good quality work. I have received decent and satisfactory support and coordination back from the client. Moreover, I have maintained this relationship with clients to gain their continuous support, corporation, involvement and contribution. For example, we always get good corporation from the client when we need to arrange a meeting or need their help. 
Because there are some other information systems except SAP system. It is very important to integrate the data and design system interface. Our team communicate with other teams and make discussions about interfaces and sharing data. I coordinated with other teams and built a good relationship with them, which could made our work go smoothly.
With the willingness and enthusiasm to help and work and also the improvement we have shown them, the client and other teams were satisfied and happy with our work and trustfully sought our help and advice.  This demonstrates that we have exceeded the client¡¯s expectation and have successfully built trust with the client other teams and also recognized as adding value. 

Teamwork & Collaboration:
There was very few IBMers in my project team. Even so I learned from many subs who are good at the SAP technology. What¡¯s more, I had more time to learn things by myself from books, materials and colleagues. They were very generous to teach me whenever I had questions. 
In this project team, I cooperated with the implementation team. I was always the earliest one to finish my work of SAP/HANA system. When I was done with my work, I always asked my team to share their work and tried to do more challenging work. I also have helped the team effectively achieve and have provided good support to our team.
When I was not sure about the solution, I asked the opinion from the team and shared my opinions with the team when needed.  With limited resources and time, there were lot of pressures from the client and other teams, we have helped and supported each other to withstand the pressure and get through the difficulties together. We did build a good friendship during the project.

*Professional Effectiveness:

There were many implement consultants on the project. I built a good relationship with them and they were generous to me whenever I had questions. I really appreciate that the colleagues I used to get along with were willing to help me as well. 
We shared the same office with key users in Hulun Buir District. And we really got along well with each other and have a harmonious atmosphere in office. When key users had problems, we were willing to help them solve the problems and understand the system deeper.
I have mastered how to build a new SAP/HANA system and helped solved at least 100 problems from the client in one month. It took me about a week to become familiar with the work and improve myself in the area I am responsible for.  Basically, I am able to apply my knowledge to productively, effectively and efficiently complete my work.  As a result, I can finish my work more quickly and efficiently. I also got good feed back from my colleagues. 
I have consistently completed the clocking to HN project punctually and correctly according to IBM policy. I demonstrated my ability in fast learning and enthusiasm in searching for knowledge and asking for help in order to get more understanding about the design and the technology and be able to provide good consulting and answer the client¡¯s questions.  As I did not get involved in collecting the user requirement at the very beginning phase of the project, I have had to make a special effort to fully understand the system design and then use it to solve the problems effectively to accept the adding requirement.

*Leading Others:

While I am not a team lead, I have helped my team to share the knowledge.  For example, I managed all the project documents and learning materials. Whenever they need any document or material, they could come to me to get the knowledge. Moreover, I made efforts to encourage seniors to organize some gatherings to build a more harmonious atmosphere in the team.

*Business & Financial Management:

While I am not a Project Manager, during this phase, I had an opportunity to become involved in managing the process of project. I weekly summarized work progress and updated the action plan. I always reminded team about the planned time when they were really busy with their work and had no time to notice it.
